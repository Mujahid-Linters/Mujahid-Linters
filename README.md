- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mujahid-Linters! I'm in an interesting position where I am actively trying to branch out my skills by trying to learn programming.
- 👀 I’m extremely interested in trying to solve complex and important problems, but most importantly, I'm trying to live an existence that makes the lives of others better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working through the Odin Project curriculum. Once I have completed that, I want to take a swing at learning C# and hopefully find work as a dev.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. I have next to no coding experience and am willing to take on anything to build out my repertoire.
